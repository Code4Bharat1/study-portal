  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between MongoDB and SQL databases?",
    answer: "MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses collections and documents, whereas SQL databases are relational and use tables and rows."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you connect to a MongoDB database?",
    answer: "You can connect to MongoDB using the `mongoose.connect()` method with the MongoDB URI."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a MongoDB document?",
    answer: "A MongoDB document is a set of key-value pairs stored in BSON format (binary JSON) within a collection."
  },
  {
    question: "What are collections in MongoDB?",
    answer: "A collection in MongoDB is a group of MongoDB documents. It's equivalent to a table in relational databases."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you perform CRUD operations in MongoDB?",
    answer: "You use methods like `find()`, `insertOne()`, `updateOne()`, and `deleteOne()` to perform CRUD operations."

  {
    question: "What is an ObjectId in MongoDB?",
    answer: "An ObjectId is a unique identifier automatically assigned to documents when they are inserted into a collection."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you index data in MongoDB?",
    answer: "You use `db.collection.createIndex()` to create indexes on fields to improve query performance."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a replica set in MongoDB?",
    answer: "A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, ensuring high availability and redundancy."
  },
  {
    question: "What is sharding in MongoDB?",
    answer: "Sharding is a method used to distribute data across multiple machines, helping scale large databases."
  },
  {
    question: "What is aggregation in MongoDB?",
    answer: "Aggregation in MongoDB is the process of transforming and combining data from multiple documents using aggregation pipelines."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the use of `find()` in MongoDB?",
    answer: "`find()` is used to retrieve documents from a collection that match a specified query."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you update documents in MongoDB?",
    answer: "You use `updateOne()`, `updateMany()`, or `replaceOne()` to update documents in MongoDB."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the `$set` operator in MongoDB?",
    answer: "The `$set` operator is used to update the value of a field in a document."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you delete documents in MongoDB?",
    answer: "You use `deleteOne()` or `deleteMany()` to remove documents from a collection."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB?",
    answer: "The aggregation pipeline allows you to process data records and return computed results by using operators like `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, etc."
  },
  {
    question: "What are MongoDB's data types?",
    answer: "MongoDB supports various data types, including string, integer, Boolean, array, object, and special types like `ObjectId` and `Date`."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a `MongoClient` in MongoDB?",
    answer: "The `MongoClient` is used to establish a connection to a MongoDB server or cluster, allowing you to interact with the database."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle transactions in MongoDB?",
    answer: "MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing you to ensure atomicity across multiple operations within a session."
