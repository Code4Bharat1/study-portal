const questionsWithAnswers = [
  {
    question: "What is React?",
    answer: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows for building reusable UI components."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the key features of React?",
    answer: "React's key features include virtual DOM, component-based architecture, one-way data flow, and hooks."
  },
  {
    question: "What is JSX?",
    answer: "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It is then transpiled into JavaScript code."
  },
  {
    question: "What are components in React?",
    answer: "Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based, and they return JSX to render the UI."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the virtual DOM in React?",
    answer: "The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to optimize performance by making minimal updates to the real DOM."
  },
  {
    question: "What is state in React?",
    answer: "State in React refers to a component's internal data. It is mutable and can be changed over time, triggering re-renders of the component."
  },
  {
    question: "What are props in React?",
    answer: "Props (short for properties) are inputs to a component. They are immutable and passed from a parent component to a child component."
  },
  {
    question: "What are React hooks?",
    answer: "React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`."
  },
  {
    question: "What is `useState` in React?",
    answer: "`useState` is a React hook used to manage state in functional components. It returns an array with the current state and a function to update it."
  },
  {
    question: "What is `useEffect` in React?",
    answer: "`useEffect` is a React hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It is similar to lifecycle methods in class components."
  },
  {
    question: "What is JSX syntax?",
    answer: "JSX syntax is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and get it transpiled to JavaScript."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between `componentDidMount` and `useEffect`?",
    answer: "`componentDidMount` is a class component lifecycle method, while `useEffect` is a hook used in functional components. Both are used for side effects, but `useEffect` runs after the render."
  },
  {
    question: "What is `React Router`?",
    answer: "React Router is a library for routing in React. It allows you to create navigation between different views or components in your application."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the `useContext` hook in React?",
    answer: "`useContext` is a React hook used to access values from a context provider, allowing you to pass data through the component tree without using props."
  },
  {
    question: "What are controlled components in React?",
    answer: "Controlled components are form elements whose value is controlled by the React state. They receive the value via props and handle changes through event handlers."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the `key` prop in React?",
    answer: "The `key` prop is used to identify elements in a list, helping React efficiently update and re-render only the changed elements."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the `useRef` hook in React?",
    answer: "`useRef` is a React hook that allows you to persist values across renders without triggering a re-render. It can also be used to reference DOM elements."
  },
  {
    question: "How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?",
    answer: "React's reconciliation algorithm compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, improving performance."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Redux?",
    answer: "Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a global state that can be accessed by all components and uses actions and reducers to update the state."
  },
