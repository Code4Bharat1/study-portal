    answer: "Lifting state up means moving state to the closest common ancestor of components that share it."
  },
  {
    question: "What is context in React?",
    answer: "Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without props drilling."
  },
  {
    question: "What is React Router?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is memoization in React?",
    answer: "Memoization (e.g., using `React.memo`, `useMemo`) optimizes performance by caching values or components."
