        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, comments are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand.</p>

    This is a multi-line comment

        <h2>Statements</h2>
        <p>JavaScript code is made up of statements, which are instructions that tell the browser what to do.</p>
        <pre><code>{`let x = 5; // This is a statement`}</code></pre>
        <h2>Case Sensitivity</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive, which means <code>Variable</code> and <code>variable</code> are considered different.</p>
