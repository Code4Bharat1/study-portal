          File uploading in Node.js is commonly handled using third-party middleware like <code>multer</code>. 
          It helps process <code>multipart/form-data</code>, which is used for uploading files. In this guide, we’ll 
          walk through the steps of setting up file upload functionality using <code>multer</code> with Express.js.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold"> Step 1: Install <code>multer</code></h2>
        <p>The first step is to install the <code>multer</code> package, which is a middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js.</p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto">
          <code>npm install multer</code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold"> Step 2: Create an Upload Endpoint</h2>
        <p>Next, we’ll create an endpoint that will handle the file upload process. Here's how to set up an Express route to handle file uploads:</p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto">
          <code>
{`const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

// Storage configuration
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'uploads/'); // upload destination
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname)); // unique filename
  }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('myfile'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded successfully!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});`}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          In this example:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>express</strong>: The Express.js framework is used to create the server and handle routes.</li>
            <li><strong>multer</strong>: The <code>multer</code> middleware is imported to handle file uploads.</li>
            <li><strong>path</strong>: The <code>path</code> module is used to manipulate file paths, especially for appending file extensions.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Storage Configuration:</strong> The <code>multer.diskStorage</code> function allows us to configure two things:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>destination</strong>: Specifies the folder where the uploaded files will be saved. In this case, files will be uploaded to the <code>uploads/</code> directory.</li>
          <li><strong>filename</strong>: Defines the naming strategy for uploaded files. Here, we're appending the current timestamp to the file’s original extension to create a unique filename.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Upload Endpoint:</strong> The <code>app.post('/upload', upload.single('myfile'), ...)</code> route is where the file upload is handled. 
        The <code>upload.single('myfile')</code> middleware processes the file from the client and stores it according to the configuration we defined. 
        The <code>myfile</code> field corresponds to the name attribute of the file input in the form. After the file is uploaded, a success message is sent as a response.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold"> Testing the Upload</h2>
        <p>Once the server is set up, we can test the upload functionality:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Using Postman:</strong> You can use Postman or similar tools to test the file upload. Ensure you set the HTTP method to <code>POST</code> and use the <code>multipart/form-data</code> encoding in the body. This encoding is necessary to upload files via HTTP.</li>
          <li><strong>HTML Form:</strong> Alternatively, you can create an HTML form with the <code>enctype="multipart/form-data"</code> attribute to allow file uploads from a web page.</li>
          <li><strong>Uploads Directory:</strong> Uploaded files will be stored in the <code>uploads/</code> directory, which should be created beforehand in your project structure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold"> Summary</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Use <code>multer</code> middleware to handle file uploads in Node.js with Express.</li>
          <li>Configure the storage destination and filename strategy to control where and how the files are stored.</li>
          <li>Support both single file uploads using <code>upload.single('fieldName')</code> or multiple files using <code>upload.array('fieldName')</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This approach to file uploading in Node.js is efficient and simple to implement. By using <code>multer</code>, you can easily handle different types of file uploads, whether it’s for a single file or multiple files.
