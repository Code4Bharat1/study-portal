# React Basic Exercise 2: Props and Data Flow

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand React props and data flow
- Learn to pass data between components
- Practice component communication patterns
- Understand one-way data binding

## 📋 Task Description
Create React components that demonstrate props usage and data flow between parent and child components. You need to show understanding of how data moves through React applications.

## 🔧 Requirements
1. Create parent and child components
2. Pass data from parent to child using props
3. Use different prop types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays)
4. Implement prop validation (optional)
5. Demonstrate component reusability with different props
6. Handle missing or default props

## 🚀 How to Complete This Exercise

### Step 1: Write Your Code
- Open the `App.jsx` file in the editor
- Create parent component with data
- Create child components that receive props
- Pass various types of data as props

### Step 2: Run Your Code
- Click the "▶️ Run" button to execute your code
- Check the output panel for any compilation errors
- Verify that props are passed and displayed correctly

### Step 3: Test Your Solution
- Click the "🧪 Test" button to run automated tests
- Tests will verify props usage and data flow
- Check that components render with different prop values

### Step 4: Submit
- Once all tests pass, click the "Submit" button
- Your solution will be evaluated for props implementation

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Parent and child components created
- [ ] Props passed from parent to child
- [ ] Different prop types used
- [ ] Component reusability demonstrated
- [ ] Props displayed correctly in child components
- [ ] Default props handled appropriately

## 📚 Key Concepts to Research
- React props and data flow
- Component communication patterns
- Prop types and validation
- Default props
- Component reusability
- One-way data binding in React

## 🔍 Testing Information
Your code will be automatically tested for:
- Proper props usage
- Data flow between components
- Component rendering with props
- Prop type handling
- Component reusability patterns

## 💡 Tips
- Props are read-only in child components
- Use destructuring for cleaner prop access
- Consider default values for optional props
- Test components with different prop combinations
- Use meaningful prop names
