# React Basic Exercise 1: JSX and Components

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand JSX syntax and structure
- Create functional React components
- Learn component composition and nesting
- Practice JSX expressions and JavaScript integration

## 📋 Task Description
Create React components using JSX syntax and demonstrate component composition. You need to show understanding of JSX fundamentals and component structure.

## 🔧 Requirements
1. Create functional React components
2. Use proper JSX syntax and structure
3. Include JavaScript expressions in JSX
4. Create nested components
5. Use props to pass data between components
6. Render components in the main App component
7. Include proper component naming conventions

## 🚀 How to Complete This Exercise

### Step 1: Write Your Code
- Open the `App.jsx` file in the editor
- Create functional components using JSX
- Include JavaScript expressions within JSX
- Compose components together

### Step 2: Run Your Code
- Click the "▶️ Run" button to execute your code
- Check the output panel for any compilation errors
- Verify that components render correctly

### Step 3: Test Your Solution
- Click the "🧪 Test" button to run the automated tests
- Tests will verify JSX syntax and component structure
- Check that components are properly composed

### Step 4: Submit
- Once all tests pass, click the "Submit" button
- Your solution will be evaluated for React fundamentals

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Functional components created
- [ ] Proper JSX syntax used
- [ ] JavaScript expressions included in JSX
- [ ] Component composition demonstrated
- [ ] Props used for data passing
- [ ] Components rendered in App
- [ ] Proper naming conventions followed

## 📚 Key Concepts to Research
- JSX syntax and rules
- Functional components in React
- Component composition patterns
- Props and data flow
- JavaScript expressions in JSX
- React component naming conventions

## 🔍 Testing Information
Your code will be automatically tested for:
- Valid JSX syntax
- Proper component structure
- Component composition
- Props usage
- JavaScript expression integration
- Naming convention adherence

## 💡 Tips
- Component names must start with capital letters
- JSX elements must be properly closed
- Use curly braces for JavaScript expressions
- Remember JSX is JavaScript, not HTML
- Test component rendering frequently
